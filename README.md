# 5x5_go
\nCSCI 561 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence - HW2
\nThis is the repository of my attempt of building a program which plays a 5x5 Go Game. 
#Read the 2022S_HW2-Description.pdf for the problem description
#rough_code.py was my first attempt at coding the game which code.py is a much more enhanced work. I submitted the code.py file for HW2 in the CSCI 561 course.
